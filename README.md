# Selection and adaptive introgression scan pipelines

## Contributions

## Introduction

The code in this repository represents variants of a general pipeline for selection scans on human genomic data, with
extensions to intersect these selection scan results with high frequency archaic core haplotypes in order to identify
adaptive introgression candidate regions.

Currently, the two subdirectories represent two distinct runs of the pipeline:

1. [`PIBv1_scans`](/PIBv1_scans/README.md): Selection and adaptive introgression scans on 17 populations from Near Oceania performed for the manuscript titled 
"Long-term isolation and archaic introgression shape functional genetic variation in Near Oceania"
2. [`Worldwide_scans`](/Worldwide_scans/README.md): Selection scans on 50 worldwide populations performed for the manuscript titled 
"Genome-wide analysis reveals loci associated with infertility under positive selection in human populations"
